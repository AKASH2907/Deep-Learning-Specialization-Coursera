# Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera
Become a Master in Deep Learning and break into AI

This is a 5 course specialization:
## 1) Neural Networks and Deep learning

## 2) Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning- Regularization and Optimization

## 3) Structuring Machine Learning Projects
It contains only quizzes, no codes thus no Jupyter files have been uploaded.

## 4) Convolutional Neural Networks
